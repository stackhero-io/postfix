Postfix is a great email server created per [Wietse Venema](http://www.porcupine.org/wietse/).
Unfortunately, no version control system of Postfix is publicly available.

This repository is a mirror of the [official FTP server](ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/mirrors/postfix-release/official/).
It is automatically updated and a new tag is created for each new archive released on the FTP server.

This work has been done by Stackhero.
If you are looking for a managed email server, please have a look at [https://www.stackhero.io/services/postfix](https://www.stackhero.io/services/postfix).

It includes out-of-the-box:

âœ… Domain customization

âœ… TLS encryption

âœ… Dedicated IPv4

âœ… SPF and DMARC

âœ… Updates in a click

âœ… Unlimited quota of emails
